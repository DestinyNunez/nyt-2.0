## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

For this project I used HTML and CSS to build the site layout and style it. End goal is to have it look like the original pictures above.

Here is the final product.





## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
